# About Us – Role flows reference (Figma / copy)

Use this table for the **“Built for the whole table”** subsection on the About page: role tabs (Founders | Leadership | Investors) and the card content per role.

| Role | Need (quote) | CLEAR delivers | Flow (steps) |
|------|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Founders** | "I need to get these decisions out of my head without losing control." | Clarity on what matters most. Freedom from micromanagement. | 1. 8-step diagnostic → one Decision Record<br>2. Decision Workspace (record, evidence, ledger)<br>3. Optional: AI advisor in context, human review, invite advisor |
| **Leadership** | "We need to know what we're actually committing to." | Clear mandates, autonomous execution. Defined success metrics. | 1. Choose area (Finance / Growth / Ops / Tech) → domain diagnostic<br>2. Analysis + recommendations → optional bootstrap to Decision Workspace<br>3. Chat with that domain's advisor; finalize and sign off in Workspace |
| **Investors** | "I need to know if this team is execution-ready." | Transparency into governance maturity. Without heavy board reporting. | 1. Portfolios → portfolio detail (enterprises, readiness, last decision)<br>2. Enterprise detail: decisions and context<br>3. Structured data and execution readiness, not long decks |

## UI pattern

- **Title:** Built for the whole table  
- **Subtitle:** Select your role to see the value.  
- **Tabs:** Founders | Leadership | Investors (pill buttons; selected = primary, unselected = secondary).  
- **Card per tab:** Icon → Quote → “CLEAR delivers:” + benefits → Short flow list → CTA (e.g. Start diagnostic).

## Links

- Founders / general entry: `/diagnostic`  
- Leadership (by area): `/book-diagnostic` then CFO / CMO / COO / CTO  
- Investors (institutional): `/institutional/portfolios` (when available to that user type)
