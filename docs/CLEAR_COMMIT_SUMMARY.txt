CLEAR: governance, EMR, outcome review, readiness, decision-scoped chat, onboarding

- Governance: artifact.canonical_json.governance (decision_type, risk_tier, required_approvers, approval_status); synthesis infers from domain/risk; UI cycle approval + PATCH artifact.
- Capability gaps: synthesis + artifact; Execution tab soft "readiness to approve" warning.
- EMR: artifact.emr (milestones, metrics, config); bootstrap in _synthesis_to_draft_artifact; Execution tab edit + PATCH.
- OutcomeReview: model, migration, POST/GET endpoints; Execution "Add outcome review" when date >= next_review_date; form + list.
- Readiness: readiness.py (band from reviews, EMR completion, approval); GET /readiness; workspace header band + tooltip.
- Decision chat: POST .../chat/start (session + initial message), POST .../chat/message; Chat tab seeded first message + conversation.
- Onboarding: used in synthesis narrative and artifact; included in chat context.
